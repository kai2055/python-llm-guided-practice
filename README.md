Python Practice Daily
 
About This Repository

This repository documents my daily Python problem-solving and learning journey.
Each notebook or .py file represents one focused practice session — ranging from beginner topics (loops, lists, functions) to data analysis, algorithms, and eventually machine learning.

I treat this as a public learning log: every day I solve problems, debug mistakes, and reflect on what I learned.

🗂️ Repository Structure

python-practice-daily/
 ┣ 📂 day01_list_comprehension/
 ┃ ┣ list_comprehension.ipynb
 ┃ ┗ README.md (short notes)
 ┣ 📂 day02_nested_lists_multiplication/
 ┃ ┣ multiplication_table.ipynb
 ┃ ┗ README.md
 ┣ README.md  

Each day folder contains my work for that day.
Some notebooks include errors and debugging notes — because learning from mistakes is part of the process.
Over time, new folders will appear as I explore more Python and ML concepts.



Long-Term Goal

To build strong programming fundamentals and gradually transition into data science and machine learning projects while maintaining daily coding discipline.
