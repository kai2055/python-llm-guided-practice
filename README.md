# Daily Python Practice: Lessons & Projects

## 🧠 My Learning Methodology
I practice Python daily using a method inspired by **traditional programming book exercises** but adapted for the AI era:

1. **Identify concepts** needed for my projects
2. **Generate targeted lessons** with AI assistance
3. **Retype every line** (never copy-paste) to ensure understanding
4. **Apply immediately** to working projects
5. **Document the connections** between learning and application

## 🔄 The Modern Equivalent of "Retyping Book Code"
Just as previous generations learned by typing out book examples, I use AI to create **customized, project-relevant lessons** that I then retype and understand line by line.

**Key differences:**
- ✓ **Tailored to my needs** (not generic book exercises)
- ✓ **Immediate project application** (not isolated examples)
- ✓ **Interactive learning** (I can ask clarifying questions)
- ✓ **Daily consistency** (building a habit)

## 🎯 Why Retype Instead of Copy-Paste?
- **Forces understanding** of each line
- **Reinforces muscle memory** for syntax
- **Allows natural experimentation** as I type
- **Builds the habit of careful coding**
